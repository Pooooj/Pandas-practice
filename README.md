1. Finding Highly Rated Books:

Task: Identify the number of books with an average rating exceeding a specific threshold (e.g., 4).
Theory: We filter the DataFrame to include only rows where the average_rating column value is greater than the chosen threshold. The resulting count represents the number of books meeting the high rating criteria.
2. Listing Books with Conditions:

Task: Create a list of books that satisfy multiple criteria, such as an average rating above a certain value and a ratings count below another value.
Theory: We use boolean filtering with logical operators (AND/OR) to select rows where specific conditions hold true for multiple columns in the DataFrame. This filtered list contains books that meet all the defined criteria.
3. Calculating Average Rating by Language:

Task: Determine the average value of the average_rating column for a specific language code (e.g., 'eng' for English).
Theory: We filter the DataFrame to include only books belonging to the target language (based on the language_code column). Then, we calculate the average of the average_rating column within this filtered subset, representing the average rating for books in that language.
4. Selecting Information for Top Entries:

Task: Extract specific information (e.g., title, author, average rating, ISBN13) for a defined number of entries (e.g., the first five books).
Theory: We use column selection techniques to choose the desired columns. Then, we apply the .head() method to limit the output to a particular number of rows from the beginning of the DataFrame, providing details for the top entries.
5. Retrieving Data from Specific Rows:

Task: Access data from specific rows (e.g., the first and fourth entries) for a chosen set of columns (e.g., language code, number of pages, ratings count).
Theory: We use label-based selection with .loc to retrieve data based on row indices. We specify the desired row indices and column names to extract the relevant information from those specific locations in the DataFrame.
6. Counting Books by Publication Year:

Task: Determine the total number of books published in a particular year (e.g., 2010).
Theory: We filter the DataFrame to include only rows where the publication_year column value matches the target year. The resulting count represents the number of books published in that year.

The functions you used with the above tasks in pandas can be categorized as follows:

1. Filtering:

.loc: Used for label-based selection by row index or labels (Task 5).
Boolean filtering with comparison operators (>, <, ==, etc.): Used to filter rows based on conditions in specific columns (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 6).
2. Selecting Data:

[]: Bracket notation for selecting columns or rows based on labels or positions (Tasks 4, 5, 6).
.head(n): Selects the first n rows from the DataFrame (Task 4).
3. Aggregation:

.mean(): Calculates the mean value of a numerical column (Task 3).
.shape[0]: Returns the number of rows in the DataFrame (Tasks 1, 6).
4. String Manipulation (Optional):

.str.contains(pattern): Checks if a string column contains a specific pattern (Task 2, assuming author names might be comma-separated).
These are the primary functions used for the described tasks. Depending on your specific DataFrame structure and manipulation needs, you might also encounter additional functions for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
